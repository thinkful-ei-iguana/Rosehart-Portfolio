    <p  id="bio">I am a programming engineer, and current student, working at 
        graduating from Engineering Immersion Career Path bootcamp at Thinkful. 
        I love diving deep into a project that needs creativity and or discipline 
        in order to make it become fully realized. Learning is a passion of mine, 
        fully understanding the ‘why and how’ of something is immensely satisfying 
        to me. I enjoy digging into the nuts and bolts of a project’s inner workings.
                 When I’m not coding I read a lot of books, playing dungeons and 
                 dragons with my wife and friends, and I’m in the process of 
                 writing and editing my book.</p>
