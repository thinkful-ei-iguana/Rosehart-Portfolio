    <h3 id="projectText">Petful adoption live application
        This application is a 'first in first out' adoption agency application with dummy data. It allows the user to
        see the landing page, begin the adoption process, choose a pet to adopt and then take home! As a user adopts
        from the agency their user is removed from the list of available adopters until eventually none are left. This
        is a work in progress. The WIP portion is making it so when pets/users are 'run out of' the user is notified and
        brought to the landing page and the list of adopters and adoptees are refreshed</h3>

        <h3 id="projectText">Kitchen Helper 2020 is the second version of Kitchen Helper, it was collaborated on with
            three other developers, names found in the README file. During this project I was the QA Lead and was in
            charge of making sure that we had 100% coverage down every API ENDPOINT, and every client side component
            with 100% passing tests. I was also in charge of making sure that user stories were fulfilled during
            construction of the application and that nothing was left out from the original design.
            This is my third full-stack project. It is meant to be an all around kitchen assistant and help you
            achieve efficiency in the kitchen.</h3>
